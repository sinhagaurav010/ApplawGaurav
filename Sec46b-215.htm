"Times New Roman";mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black;
background:white'>(<span class=GramE>a</span>)(1) The Superior Court or a
family support magistrate may make and enforce orders for payment of support
against any person who neglects or refuses to furnish necessary support to such
person's spouse or a child under the age of eighteen or as otherwise provided
in this subsection, according to such person's ability to furnish such support,
notwithstanding the provisions of section 46b-37. If such child is unmarried
and a full-time high school student, such support shall continue according to
the parents' respective abilities, if such child is in need of support, until
such child completes the twelfth grade or attains the age of nineteen,
whichever occurs first.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Any such support order in <span
class=GramE>a</span> IV-D support case shall include a provision for the health
care coverage of the child. Such provision may include an order for either
parent or both parents to provide such coverage under any or all of
subparagraphs (A), (B) or (C) of this subdivision.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) The provision for health care coverage
may include an order for either parent to name any child as a beneficiary of
any medical or dental insurance or benefit plan carried by such parent or
available to such parent at a reasonable cost, as defined in subparagraph (D)
of this subdivision. If such order requires the parent to maintain insurance
available through an employer, the order shall be enforced using a National
Medical Support Notice as provided in section 46b-88.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) The provision for health care coverage
may include an order for either parent to: (<span class=SpellE>i</span>) Apply
for and maintain coverage on behalf of the child under the HUSKY Plan, Part B;
or (ii) provide cash medical support, as described in subparagraphs (E) and (F)
of this subdivision. An order under this subparagraph shall be made only if the
cost to the parent obligated to maintain coverage under the HUSKY Plan, Part B,
or provide cash medical support is reasonable, as defined in subparagraph (D)
of this subdivision. An order under clause (<span class=SpellE>i</span>) of
this subparagraph shall be made only if insurance coverage as described in
subparagraph (A) of this subdivision is unavailable at reasonable cost to
either parent, or inaccessible to the child.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C) An order for payment of the child's
medical and dental expenses, other than those described in clause (ii) of
subparagraph (E) of this subdivision, that are not covered by insurance or
reimbursed in any other manner shall be entered in accordance with the child
support guidelines established pursuant to section 46b-215a.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(D) Health care coverage shall be deemed
reasonable in cost if: (<span class=SpellE>i</span>) The parent obligated to
maintain such coverage would qualify as a low-income obligor under the child
support guidelines established pursuant to section 46b-215a, based solely on
such parent's income, and the cost does not exceed five per cent of such
parent's net income; or (ii) the parent obligated to maintain such coverage
would not qualify as a low-income obligor under such guidelines and the cost
does not exceed seven and one-half per cent of such parent's net income. In
either case, net income shall be determined in accordance with the child
support guidelines established pursuant to section 46b-215a. If a parent
obligated to maintain insurance must obtain coverage for himself or herself to
comply with the order to provide coverage for the child, reasonable cost shall
be determined based on the combined cost of coverage for such parent and such
child.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(E) Cash medical support means (<span
class=SpellE>i</span>) an amount ordered to be paid toward the cost of premiums
for health insurance coverage provided by a public entity, including the HUSKY
Plan, Part A or Part B, except as provided in subparagraph (F) of this
subdivision, or by another parent through employment or otherwise, or (ii) an
amount ordered to be paid, either directly to a medical provider or to the
person obligated to pay such provider, toward any ongoing extraordinary medical
and dental expenses of the child that are not covered by insurance or
reimbursed in any other manner, provided such expenses are documented and
identified specifically on the record. Cash medical support, as described in
clauses (<span class=SpellE>i</span>) and (ii) of this subparagraph, may be
ordered in lieu of an order under subparagraph (A) of this subdivision to be
effective until such time as health insurance that is accessible to the child
and reasonable in cost becomes available, or in addition to an order under
subparagraph (A) of this subdivision, provided the total cost to the obligated
parent of insurance and cash medical support is reasonable, as described in
subparagraph (D) of this subdivision. An order for cash medical support shall
be payable to the state or the custodial party, as their interests may appear,
provided an order under clause (<span class=SpellE>i</span>) of this
subparagraph shall be effective only as long as health insurance coverage is
maintained. Any unreimbursed medical and dental expenses not covered by an
order issued pursuant to clause (ii) of this subparagraph are subject to an
order for unreimbursed medical and dental expenses pursuant to subparagraph (C)
of this subdivision.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(F) Cash medical support to offset the cost
of any insurance payable under the HUSKY Plan, Part A or Part B, shall not be
ordered against a noncustodial parent who is a low-income obligor, as defined
in the child support guidelines established pursuant to section 46b-215a, or
against a custodial parent of children covered under the HUSKY Plan, Part A or
Part B.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Proceedings to obtain orders of support
under this section shall be commenced by the service on the liable person or
persons of a verified petition, with summons and order, of the husband or wife,
child or any relative or the conservator, guardian or support enforcement
officer, town or state, or any selectmen or the public official charged with
the administration of public assistance of the town, or in IV-D support cases,
as defined in subdivision (13) of subsection (b) of section 46b-231, the
Commissioner of Social Services. The verified petition, summons and order shall
be filed in the judicial district in which the petitioner or respondent resides
or does business, or if filed in the Family Support Magistrate Division, in the
judicial district in which the petitioner or respondent resides or does
business.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) For purposes of this section, the term
&quot;child&quot; shall include one born out of wedlock whose father has
acknowledged in writing paternity of such child or has been adjudged the father
by a court of competent jurisdiction, or a child who was born before marriage
whose parents afterwards intermarry.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Said court or family support magistrate
shall also have authority to make and enforce orders directed to the
conservator or guardian of any person, or payee of Social Security or other
benefits to which such person is entitled, to the extent of the income or
estate held by such fiduciary or payee in any such capacity.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Said court or family support magistrate
shall also have authority to determine, order and enforce payment of any sums
due under a written agreement to support against the person liable for such
support under such agreement.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) (A) The court or family support
magistrate may also determine, order and enforce payment of any support due
because of neglect or refusal to furnish support prior to the action. In the
case of a child born out of wedlock whose parents have not intermarried, the
father's liability for such support shall be limited to the three years next
preceding the filing of a petition pursuant to this section.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) In the determination of support due based
on neglect or refusal to furnish support prior to the action, the support due
for periods of time prior to the action shall be based upon the obligor's
ability to pay during such prior periods, as determined in accordance with the
child support guidelines established pursuant to section 46b-215a. The state
shall disclose to the court any information in its possession concerning
current and past ability to pay. If no information is available to the court
concerning past ability to pay, the court may determine the support due for
periods of time prior to the action as if past ability to pay is equal to
current ability to pay, if current ability is known. If current ability to pay
is not known, the court shall determine the past ability to pay based on the obligor's
work history, if known, or if not known, on the state minimum wage that was in
effect during such periods, provided only actual earnings shall be used to
determine ability to pay for past periods during which the obligor was a
full-time high school student or was incarcerated, institutionalized or
incapacitated.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C) Any finding of support due for periods
of time prior to an action in which the obligor failed to appear shall be
entered subject to adjustment. Such adjustment may be made upon motion of any
party, and the state in IV-D cases shall make such motion if it obtains
information that would have substantially affected the court's determination of
past ability to pay if such information had been available to the court. Motion
for adjustment under this subparagraph may be made not later than twelve months
from the date upon which the obligor receives notification of (<span
class=SpellE>i</span>) the amount of such finding of support due for periods of
time prior to the action, and (ii) the right not later than twelve months from
the date of receipt of such notification to present evidence as to such
obligor's past ability to pay support for such periods of time prior to the
action. A copy of any support order entered, subject to adjustment, shall state
in plain language the basis for the court's determination of past support, the
right to request an adjustment and to present information concerning the
obligor's past ability to pay, and the consequences of a failure to request
such adjustment.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) (A) The judge or family support
magistrate shall cause a summons, signed by such judge or magistrate, by the
clerk of said court or Family Support Magistrate Division, or by a commissioner
of the Superior Court to be issued requiring such liable person or persons to appear
in court or before a family support magistrate, at a time and place as
determined by the clerk but not more than ninety days after the issuance of the
summons. Service may be made by a state marshal, any proper officer or any
investigator employed by the Department of <span class=GramE>Social</span>
Services or by the Commissioner of Administrative Services. The state marshal,
proper officer or investigator shall make due return of process to the court
not less than twenty-one days before the date assigned for hearing. Upon proof
of the service of the summons to appear in court or before a family support
magistrate at the time and place named for hearing upon such petition, the
failure of the defendant or defendants to appear shall not prohibit the court
or family support magistrate from going forward with the hearing. If the
summons and order is signed by a commissioner of the Superior Court, upon proof
of service of the summons to appear in court or before a family support
magistrate and upon the failure of the defendant to appear at the time and
place named for hearing upon the petition, request may be made by the
petitioner to the court or family support magistrate for an order that a capias
<span class=SpellE>mittimus</span> be issued.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) In the case of a person supported
wholly or in part by a town, the welfare authority of the town shall notify the
responsible relatives of such person of the amount of assistance given, the
beginning date thereof and the amount of support expected from each of them, if
any, and if any such relative does not contribute in such expected amount, the
superior court for the judicial district in which such town is located or a
family support magistrate sitting in the judicial district in which such town
is located may order such relative or relatives to contribute to such support,
from the time of the beginning date of expense shown on the notice, such sum as
said court or family support magistrate deems reasonably within each such
relative's ability to support such person.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C) The court, or any judge thereof, or
family support magistrate when said court or family support magistrate is not
sitting, may require the defendant or defendants to become bound, with
sufficient surety, to the state, town or person bringing the complaint, to
abide such judgment as may be rendered on such complaint. Failure of the
defendant or defendants to obey any order made under this <span class=GramE>section,</span>
may be punished as contempt of court and the costs of commitment of any person
imprisoned therefor shall be paid by the state as in criminal cases. Except as
otherwise provided, upon proof of the service of the summons to appear in court
or before a family support magistrate at the time and place named for a hearing
upon the failure of the defendant or defendants to obey such court order or
order of the family support magistrate, the court or family support magistrate
may order a capias <span class=SpellE>mittimus</span> be issued, and directed
to some proper officer to arrest such defendant or defendants and bring such
defendant or defendants before the Superior Court for the contempt hearing.
When any person is found in contempt under this section, the court or family
support magistrate may award to the petitioner a reasonable attorney's fee and
the fees of the officer serving the contempt citation, such sums to be paid by
the person found in contempt.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9) In addition to or in lieu of such
contempt proceedings, the court or family support magistrate, upon a finding
that any person has failed to obey any order made under this section, may: (A)
Order a plan for payment of any past-due support owing under such order, or, in
IV-D cases, if such obligor is not incapacitated, order such obligor to
participate in work activities which may include, but shall not be limited to,
job search, training, work experience and participation in the job training and
retraining program established by the Labor Commissioner pursuant to section
31-3t; (B) suspend any professional, occupational, recreational, commercial
driver's or motor vehicle operator's license as provided in subsections (b) to
(e), inclusive, of section 46b-220, provided such failure was without good
cause; (C) issue an income withholding order against such amount of any debt
accruing by reason of personal services as provided by sections 52-362, 52-362b
and 52-362c; and (D) order executions against any real, personal, or other
property of such person which cannot be categorized solely as either, for
payment of accrued and unpaid amounts due under such order.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(10) No entry fee, judgment fee or any
other court fee shall be charged by the court or the family support magistrate
to either party in proceedings under this section.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(11) Any written agreement to <span
class=GramE>support which is filed with the court</span> or the Family Support
Magistrate Division shall have the effect of an order of the court or a family
support magistrate.<br>
<br>
(b) The Attorney General of the state of Connecticut and the attorney
representing a <span class=GramE>town,</span> shall become a party for the
interest of the state of Connecticut and such town, in any proceedings for support
which concerns any person who is receiving or has received public assistance or
care from the state or any town. The Attorney General shall represent the IV-D
agency in non-TANF IV-D support cases if the IV-D agency determines that such
representation is required pursuant to guidelines issued by the Commissioner of
Social Services.<br>
<br>
(c) The court or a family support magistrate shall direct all payments on
orders of support in IV-D cases to be made to the state acting by and through
the IV-D agency. In IV-D support cases, the IV-D agency or a support
enforcement agency under cooperative agreement with the IV-D agency may, upon
notice to the obligor and <span class=SpellE>obligee</span>, redirect payments
for the support of any child receiving child support enforcement services
either to the state of Connecticut or to the present custodial party, as their
interests may appear, provided neither the obligor nor the <span class=SpellE>obligee</span>
objects in writing within ten business days from the mailing date of such
notice. Any such notice shall be sent by first class mail to the most recent
address of such obligor and <span class=SpellE>obligee</span>, as recorded in
the state case registry pursuant to section 46b-218, and a copy of such notice
shall be filed with the court or family support magistrate if both the obligor and
<span class=SpellE>obligee</span> fail to object to the redirected payments
within ten business days from the mailing date of such notice. All payments
made shall be distributed as required by Title IV-D of the Social Security Act.<br>
<br>
(d) No order for support made by the court or a family support magistrate shall
be stayed by an appeal but such order shall continue in effect until a
determination is made thereon upon such appeal; if however as a result of such
appeal or further hearing, the amount of such order is reduced or vacated, such
defendant shall be credited or reimbursed accordingly.<br>
<br>
(e) Any court or family support magistrate, called upon to enforce a support
order, shall insure that such order is reasonable in light of the obligor's
ability to pay. Any support order entered pursuant to this section, or any
support order from another jurisdiction subject to enforcement by the state of
Connecticut, may be modified by motion of the party seeking such modification
upon a showing of a substantial change in the circumstances of either party or
upon a showing that such support order substantially deviates from the child
support guidelines established pursuant to section 46b-215a, unless there was a
specific finding on the record that the application of the guidelines would be
inequitable or inappropriate, provided the court or family support magistrate
finds that the obligor or the <span class=SpellE>obligee</span> and any other
interested party have received actual notice of the pendency of such motion and
of the time and place of the hearing on such motion. There shall be a
rebuttable presumption that any deviation of less than fifteen per cent from
the child support guidelines is not substantial and any deviation of fifteen
per cent or more from the guidelines is substantial. Modification may be made
of such support order without regard to whether the order was issued before, on
or after May 9, 1991. No such support orders may be subject to retroactive
modification, except that the court or family support magistrate may order
modification with respect to any period during which there is a pending motion
for a modification of an existing support order from the date of service of the
notice of such pending motion upon the opposing party pursuant to section
52-50. In any hearing to modify any support order from another jurisdiction the
court or the family support magistrate shall conduct the proceedings in
accordance with the procedure set forth in sections 46b-213o to 46b-213q,
inclusive.<br>
<br>
(f) In IV-D support cases, as defined in subdivision (13) of subsection (b) of
section 46b-231, a copy of any support order established or modified pursuant
to this section or, in the case of a motion for modification of an existing
support order, a notice of determination that there should be no change in the
amount of the support order, shall be provided to each party and the state case
registry within fourteen days after issuance of such order or determination.<br>
