Court.<br>
<br>
(m)&nbsp;<b>Magistrates' powers and duties.</b>&nbsp;The Chief Family Support
Magistrate and the family support magistrates shall have the powers and duties
enumerated in this subsection.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) A family support magistrate in IV-D
support cases may compel the attendance of witnesses or the obligor under a
summons issued pursuant to sections 17b-745, 46b-172 and 46b-215, a subpoena
issued pursuant to section 52-143, or a citation for failure to obey an order
of a family support magistrate or a judge of the Superior Court. If a person is
served with any such summons, subpoena or citation issued by a family support
magistrate or the assistant clerk of the Family Support Magistrate Division and
fails to appear, a family support magistrate may issue a capias <span
class=SpellE>mittimus</span> directed to a proper officer to arrest the obligor
or the witness and bring him before a family support magistrate. Whenever such
a capias <span class=SpellE>mittimus</span> is ordered, the family support
magistrate shall establish a recognizance to the state of Connecticut in the
form of a bond of such character and amount as to assure the appearance of the
obligor at the next regular session of the Family Support Magistrate Division
in the judicial district in which the matter is pending. If the obligor posts
such a bond, and thereafter fails to appear before the family support
magistrate at the time and place he is ordered to appear, the family support
magistrate may order the bond forfeited, and the proceeds thereof distributed
as required by Title IV-D of the Social Security Act.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Family support magistrates shall hear
and determine matters involving child and spousal support in IV-D support cases
including petitions for support brought pursuant to sections 17b-81, 17b-179,
17b-745 and 46b-215; applications for show cause orders in IV-D support cases
brought pursuant to subsection (b) of section 46b-172, and actions for interstate
enforcement of child and spousal support and paternity under sections 46b-212
to 46b-213v, inclusive, and shall hear and determine all motions for
modifications of child and spousal support in such cases. In all IV-D support
cases, family support magistrates shall have the authority to order any obligor
who is subject to a plan for reimbursement of past-due support and is not
incapacitated, to participate in work activities which may include, but shall
not be limited to, job search, training, work experience and participation in
the job training and retraining program established by the Labor Commissioner
pursuant to section 31-3t. A family support magistrate shall not modify an
order for periodic payment on an arrearage due the state for state assistance which
has been discontinued to increase such payments, unless the family support
magistrate first determines that the state has made a reasonable effort to
notify the current recipient of child support, at the most current address
available to the IV-D agency, of the pendency of the motion to increase such
periodic arrearage payments and of the time and place of the hearing on such
motion. If such recipient appears, either personally or through a
representative, at such hearing, the family support magistrate shall determine
whether the order in effect for child support is reasonable in relation to the
current financial circumstances of the parties, prior to modifying an order
increasing such periodic arrearage payments.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Family support magistrates shall review
and approve or modify all agreements for support in IV-D support cases filed
with the Family Support Magistrate Division in accordance with sections
17b-179, 17b-745, 46b-172, 46b-215 and subsection (c) of section 53-304.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Motions for modification of existing
child and spousal support orders entered by the Superior Court in IV-D support
cases, including motions to modify existing child and spousal support orders
entered in actions brought pursuant to chapter 815j, shall be brought in the
Family Support Magistrate Division and decided by a family support magistrate.
Family support magistrates, in deciding if a spousal or child support order
should be modified, shall make such determination based upon the criteria set
forth in sections 46b-84 and 46b-215b. A person who is aggrieved by a decision
of a family support magistrate modifying a Superior Court order is entitled to
appeal such decision in accordance with the provisions of subsection (n) of
this section.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Proceedings to establish paternity in
IV-D support cases shall be filed in the family support magistrate division for
the judicial district where the mother or putative father resides. The matter
shall be heard and determined by a family support magistrate in accordance with
the provisions of chapter 815y.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Agreements for support obtained in IV-D
support cases shall be filed with the assistant clerk of the family support
magistrate division for the judicial district where the mother or the father of
the child resides, pursuant to subsection (b) of section 46b-172, and shall
become effective as an order upon filing with the clerk. <span class=GramE>Such
support agreements shall be reviewed by a family support magistrate who shall
approve or disapprove the agreement</span>. If <span class=GramE>the support agreement
filed with the clerk is disapproved by a family support magistrate</span>, such
disapproval shall have a retroactive effect.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) Family support magistrates shall
enforce orders for child and spousal support entered by such family support
magistrate and by the Superior Court in IV-D support cases by citing an obligor
for contempt. Family support magistrates, in IV-D support cases, may order any
obligor who is subject to a plan for reimbursement of past-due support and is
not incapacitated, to participate in work activities which may include, but
shall not be limited to, job search, training, work experience and
participation in the job training and retraining program established by the
Labor Commissioner pursuant to section 31-3t. Family support magistrates shall
also enforce income withholding orders entered pursuant to section 52-362,
including any additional amounts to be applied toward liquidation of any
arrearage, as required under subsection (e) of said section. Family support
magistrates may require the obligor to furnish recognizance to the state of
Connecticut in the form of a cash deposit or bond of such character and in such
amount as the Family Support Magistrate Division deems proper to assure
appearance at the next regular session of the Family Support Magistrate
Division in the judicial district in which the matter is pending. Upon failure
of the obligor to post such bond, the family support magistrate may refer the
obligor to a community correctional center until he has complied with such
order, provided the obligor shall be heard at the next regular session of the
Family Support Magistrate Division in the court to which he was summoned. If no
regular session is held within seven days of such referral, the family support
magistrate shall either cause a special session of the Family Support
Magistrate Division to be convened, or <span class=GramE>the obligor shall be
heard by a Superior Court judge in the judicial district</span> in which the
matter is pending. If the obligor fails to appear before the family support
magistrate at the time and place he is ordered to appear, the family support
magistrate may order the bond, if any, forfeited, and the proceeds thereof
distributed as required by Title IV-D of the Social Security Act, and the
family support magistrate may issue a capias <span class=SpellE>mittimus</span>
for the arrest of the obligor, ordering him to appear before the family support
magistrate. A family support magistrate may determine whether or not an obligor
is in contempt of the order of the Superior Court or of a family support
magistrate and may make such orders as are provided by law to enforce a support
obligation, except that if the family support magistrate determines that
incarceration of an obligor for failure to obey a support order may be
indicated, the family support magistrate shall inform the obligor of his right
to be represented by an attorney and his right to a court-appointed attorney to
represent him if he is indigent. If the obligor claims he is indigent and
desires an attorney to represent him, the family support magistrate shall
conduct a hearing to determine if the obligor is indigent. If, after such
hearing, the family support magistrate finds that the obligor is indigent, the
family support magistrate shall appoint an attorney to represent the obligor.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) Agreements between parties as to
custody and visitation of minor children in IV-D support cases may be filed
with the assistant clerk of the Family Support Magistrate Division. <span
class=GramE>Such agreements shall be reviewed by a family support magistrate,
who shall approve the agreement unless he finds such agreement is not in the
best interests of the child</span>. Agreements between parties as to custody
and visitation in IV-D support cases shall be enforced in the same manner as
agreements for support are enforced, pursuant to subdivision (7) of this
subsection.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9) Whenever an obligor is before a family
support magistrate in proceedings to establish, modify or enforce a support
order in a IV-D support case and such order is not secured by an income
withholding order, the family support magistrate may require the obligor to
execute a bond or post other security sufficient to perform such order for
support, provided the family support magistrate finds that such a bond is
available for purchase within the financial means of the obligor. Upon failure
of such obligor to comply with such support order, the family support
magistrate may order the bond or the security forfeited and the proceeds
thereof distributed as required by Title IV-D of the Social Security Act.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(10) In any proceeding in the Family
Support Magistrate Division, if the family support magistrate finds that a
party is indigent and unable to pay a fee or fees payable to the court or to
pay the cost of service of process, the family support magistrate shall waive
such fee or fees and the cost of service of process shall be paid by the state.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(11) A family support magistrate may
dismiss any action or <span class=GramE>proceeding</span> which the family
support magistrate may hear and determine.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(12) A family support magistrate may order
parties to participate in the parenting education program in accordance with
the provisions of section 46b-69b.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(13) Family support magistrates may issue
writs of habeas corpus ad <span class=SpellE>testificandum</span> in IV-D
support cases for persons in the custody of the Commissioner of Correction.<br>
<br>
(n)&nbsp;<b>Appeal procedure.</b>&nbsp;(1) A person who is aggrieved by a final
decision of a family support magistrate is entitled to judicial review by way
of appeal under this section.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Proceedings for such appeal shall be
instituted by filing a petition in superior court for the judicial district in
which the decision of the family support magistrate was rendered not later than
fourteen days after filing of the final decision with an assistant clerk
assigned to the Family Support Magistrate Division or, if a rehearing is
requested, not later than fourteen days after filing of the notice of the
decision thereon. In <span class=GramE>a</span> IV-D support case, such
petitions shall be accompanied by a certification that copies of the petition
have been served upon the IV-D agency as defined in subsection (b) of this
section and all parties of record. Service upon the IV-D agency may be made by
the appellant mailing a copy of the petition by certified mail to the office of
the Attorney General in Hartford.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Within fourteen days after the filing
of the petition, or within such further time as may be allowed by the court,
the Family Support Magistrate Division shall transmit to the reviewing court
the original or a certified copy of the entire record of the proceeding
appealed from, which shall include the decision of the family support
magistrate. The court may require or permit subsequent corrections or additions
to the record.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The aggrieved party shall file with his
appeal a statement that no transcript is required for the purpose of
determining the issues raised on appeal or a statement that he has ordered a
transcript. A transcript may be filed by any party to an appeal and shall be
filed within thirty days from the filing of said appeal unless the time for
filing such transcript is extended by order of the Superior Court or the family
support magistrate. <span class=GramE>Costs of preparing the transcript shall
be paid by the party ordering the preparation of</span> the transcript.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) If, before the date set for hearing,
application is made to the Superior Court for leave to present additional
evidence, and it is shown to the satisfaction of the court that the additional
evidence is material and that there were good reasons for failure to present it
in the proceeding before the family support magistrate, the Superior Court may
permit additional evidence be taken before it upon conditions determined by the
court.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) The appeal shall be conducted by the
Superior Court without a jury and shall be confined to the record and such
additional evidence as the Superior Court has permitted to be introduced. The
Superior Court, upon request, shall hear oral argument and receive written
briefs.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) The Superior Court may affirm the
decision of the family support magistrate or remand the case for further
proceedings. The Superior Court may reverse or modify the decision if
substantial rights of the appellant have been prejudiced because the decision
of the family support magistrate is: (A) In violation of constitutional or
statutory provisions; (B) in excess of the statutory authority of the family
support magistrate; (C) made upon unlawful procedure; (D) affected by other
error of law; (E) clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and

to an appeal under this subsection may be retroactive to the date of the
original order entered by the family support magistrate.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9) Upon all such <span class=GramE>appeals

permitted for filing of a transcript of testimony if preparation of such
transcript is required, file with the clerk of the superior court to which the
appeal is to be taken an application for waiver of payment of such fees, costs
and necessary expenses. The application shall conform to rules adopted pursuant
to section 51-14. After such hearing as the Superior Court determines is
necessary, the Superior Court shall enter its judgment on the application,

magistrate, but it shall continue in effect until the appeal is decided, and
thereafter, unless denied, until changed by further order of a family support
magistrate or the Superior Court.<br>
<br>
(q)&nbsp;<b>Order issued by Superior Court supersedes previous orders.</b>&nbsp;When
an order for child or spousal support has been entered against an obligor by
the Superior Court in an action originating in the Superior Court, such order
