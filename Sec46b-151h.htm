"Times New Roman"'>The compacting states to this Interstate Compact recognize
that each state is responsible for the proper supervision or return of
juveniles, delinquents and status offenders who are on probation or parole and
who have absconded, escaped or run away from supervision and control and in so
doing have endangered their own safety and the safety of others. The compacting
states also recognize that each state is responsible for the safe return of
juveniles who have run away from home and in doing so have left their state of
residence. The compacting states also recognize that Congress, by enacting the
Crime Control Act, 4 USC Section 112 (1965), has authorized and encouraged
compacts for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in the prevention of
crime.<br>
<br>
It is the purpose of this compact, through means of joint and cooperative
action among the compacting states to: (A) Ensure that the adjudicated
juveniles and status offenders subject to this compact are provided adequate
supervision and services in the receiving state as ordered by the adjudicating
judge or parole authority in the sending state; (B) ensure that the public
safety interests of the citizens, including the victims of juvenile offenders,
in both the sending and receiving states are adequately protected; (C) return
juveniles who have run away, absconded or escaped from supervision or control
or have been accused of an offense to the state requesting their return; (D)
make contracts for the cooperative institutionalization in public facilities in
member states for delinquent youth needing special services; (E) provide for
the effective tracking and supervision of juveniles; (F) equitably allocate the
costs, benefits and obligations of the compacting states; (G) establish
procedures to manage the movement between states of juvenile offenders released
to the community under the jurisdiction of courts, juvenile departments, or any
other criminal or juvenile justice agency which has jurisdiction over juvenile
offenders; (H) ensure immediate notice to jurisdictions where defined offenders
are authorized to travel or to relocate across state lines; (I) establish
procedures to resolve pending charges (detainers) against juvenile offenders
prior to transfer or release to the community under the terms of this compact;
(J) establish a system of uniform data collection on information pertaining to
juveniles subject to this compact that allows access by authorized juvenile
justice and criminal justice officials, and regular reporting of compact
activities to heads of state executive, judicial and legislative branches and
juvenile and criminal justice administrators; (K) monitor compliance with rules
governing interstate movement of juveniles and initiate interventions to
address and correct noncompliance; (L) coordinate training and education
regarding the regulation of interstate movement of juveniles for officials
involved in such activity; and (M) coordinate the implementation and operation
of the compact with the Interstate Compact for the Placement of Children, the
Interstate Compact for Adult Offender Supervision and other compacts affecting
juveniles particularly in those cases where concurrent or overlapping
supervision issues arise. It is the policy of the compacting states that the
activities conducted by the Interstate Commission created herein are the
formation of public policies and therefore are public business. Furthermore,
the compacting states shall cooperate and observe their individual and
collective duties and responsibilities for the prompt return and acceptance of
juveniles subject to the provisions of this compact. The provisions of this
compact shall be reasonably and liberally construed to accomplish the purposes
and policies of the compact.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. The compacting states
hereby create the &quot;Interstate Commission for Juveniles&quot;. The
Interstate Commission shall be a body corporate and joint agency of the
compacting states. The Interstate Commission shall have all the
responsibilities, powers and duties set forth in this compact, and such
additional powers as may be conferred upon it by subsequent action of the
respective legislatures of the compacting states in accordance with the terms
of this compact.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B. The Interstate Commission shall consist
of commissioners appointed by the appropriate appointing authority in each
state pursuant to the rules and requirements of each compacting state and in
consultation with the State Council for Interstate Juvenile Supervision created
under Article IX of this compact. The commissioner shall be the compact
administrator, deputy compact administrator or designee from that state who
shall serve on the Interstate Commission in such capacity under or pursuant to
the applicable law of the compacting state.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C. In addition to the commissioners who are
the voting representatives of each state, the Interstate Commission shall
include individuals who are not commissioners, but who are members of
interested organizations. Such non-commissioner members must include a member of
the national organizations of governors, legislators, state chief justices and
attorneys general; representatives of the Interstate Compact for Adult Offender
Supervision and the Interstate Compact for the Placement of Children; juvenile
justice and juvenile corrections officials; and crime victims. All
non-commissioner members of the Interstate Commission shall be ex-officio,
nonvoting, members. The Interstate Commission may provide in its bylaws for
such additional ex-officio, nonvoting, members, including members of other
national organizations, in such numbers as shall be determined by the
Interstate Commission.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D. Each compacting state represented at any
meeting of the Interstate Commission is entitled to one vote. A majority of the
compacting states shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business,

and, upon the request of a simple majority of the compacting states, shall call
additional meetings. Public notice shall be given of all meetings and meetings
shall be open to the public.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;F. The Interstate Commission shall
establish an executive committee, which shall include Interstate Commission
officers, members and others as determined by the bylaws. The executive
committee shall have the power to act on behalf of the Interstate Commission
during periods when the Interstate Commission is not in session, with the
exception of rulemaking or amendment to the compact. The executive committee
shall oversee the day-to-day activities of the administration of the compact
managed by an executive director and Interstate Commission staff; administer
enforcement and compliance with the provisions of the compact and the bylaws
and rules of the Interstate Commission, and perform such other duties as
directed by the Interstate Commission or set forth in the bylaws.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;G. Each member of the Interstate Commission
shall have the right and power to cast a vote to which that compacting state is
entitled and to participate in the business and affairs of the Interstate
Commission. A member shall vote in person and shall not delegate a vote to
another compacting state, except that, a commissioner, in consultation with the
state council, shall appoint another authorized representative, in the absence
of the commissioner from that state, to cast a vote on behalf of the compacting
state at a specified meeting. The bylaws may provide for members' participation
in meetings by telephone or other means of telecommunication or electronic
communication.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;H. The Interstate Commission's bylaws shall

inspection or copying. The Interstate Commission may exempt from disclosure any
information or official records to the extent they would adversely affect
personal privacy rights or proprietary interests.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I. Public notice shall be given of all
meetings and all meetings shall be open to the public, except as set forth in
the rules or as otherwise provided in the compact. The Interstate Commission
and any of its committees may close a meeting to the public if it determines by
two-thirds vote that an open meeting would be likely to:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Relate solely to the Interstate
Commission's internal personnel practices and procedures;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Disclose matters specifically exempted
from disclosure by statute;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Disclose trade secrets or commercial or
financial information which is privileged or confidential;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Involve accusing any person of a crime,
or formally censuring any person;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Disclose information of a personal
nature where disclosure would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of
personal privacy;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. Disclose investigative records compiled
for law enforcement purposes;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. Disclose information contained in or
related to examination, operating or condition reports prepared by, or on
behalf of or for the use of, the Interstate Commission with respect to a
regulated person or entity for the purpose of regulation or supervision of such
person or entity;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. Disclose information, the premature
disclosure of which would significantly endanger the stability of a regulated
person or entity; or<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. Specifically relate to the Interstate
Commission's issuance of a subpoena, or its participation in a civil action or
other legal proceeding.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;J. For every meeting closed pursuant to
paragraph I of this article, the Interstate Commission's legal counsel shall
publicly certify that, in the legal counsel's opinion, the meeting may be
closed to the public, and shall reference each relevant <span class=SpellE>exemptive</span>
provision. The Interstate Commission shall keep minutes which shall fully and
clearly describe all matters discussed in any meeting and shall provide a full
and accurate summary of any actions taken, and the reasons therefor, including
a description of each of the views expressed on any item and the record of any
roll call vote, reflected in the vote of each member on the question. All
documents considered in connection with any action shall be identified in such
minutes.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;K. The Interstate Commission shall collect
standardized data concerning the interstate movement of juveniles as directed
through its rules which shall specify the data to be collected, the means of
collection and data exchange and reporting requirements. Such methods of data
collection, exchange and reporting shall insofar as is reasonably possible
conform to up-to-date technology and coordinate its information functions with
the appropriate repository of records.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

become binding as of the date specified, as published with the final version of
the rule as approved by the Interstate Commission.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C. When promulgating a rule, the Interstate
Commission shall, at a minimum:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Publish the proposed rule's entire text
stating the reason or reasons for that proposed rule;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Allow and invite any and all persons to
submit written data, facts, opinions and arguments, which information shall be
added to the record, and be made publicly available;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Provide an opportunity for an informal
hearing if petitioned by ten or more persons; and<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Promulgate a final rule and its
effective date, if appropriate, based on comment from state or local officials
and other interested parties.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D. Not later than sixty days after a rule
is promulgated, any interested person may file a petition in the United States
District Court for the District of Columbia or in the federal district court
where the Interstate Commission's principal office is located for judicial
review of such rule. If the court finds that the Interstate Commission's action
is not supported by substantial evidence in the rulemaking record, the court
shall hold the rule unlawful and set it aside. For purposes of this subsection,
evidence is substantial if it would be considered substantial evidence under
the Model State Administrative Procedures Act.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E. If a majority of the legislatures of the
compacting states rejects a rule, those states may, by enactment of a statute
or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the compact, cause that such
rule shall have no further force and effect in any compacting state.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;F. The existing rules governing the
operation of the Interstate Compact on Juveniles superseded by this compact
shall be null and void twelve months after the first meeting of the Interstate
Commission.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;G. Upon determination by the Interstate
Commission that a state-of-emergency exists, it may promulgate an emergency
rule which shall become effective immediately upon adoption, provided that the
usual rulemaking procedures provided in this article are retroactively applied
to the emergency rule as soon as reasonably possible, but no later than ninety
days after the effective date of the emergency rule.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Once effective, the compact shall
continue in force and remain binding upon each compacting state. A compacting
state may withdraw from the compact by specifically repealing the statute which
enacted the compact into law.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. The effective date of withdrawal is the
effective date of the repeal.<br>

notify the chairperson of the Interstate Commission in writing upon the
introduction of legislation repealing this compact in the withdrawing state.
The Interstate Commission shall notify the other compacting states of the
withdrawing state's intent to withdraw within sixty days of its receipt
thereof.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. The withdrawing state is responsible for
all assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective
date of withdrawal, including any obligations, the performance of which extend
beyond the effective date of withdrawal.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section B. Technical Assistance, Fines,
Suspension, Termination and Default<br>
<br>
<span class=GramE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1</span>. If the
Interstate Commission determines that any compacting state has at any time
defaulted in the performance of any of its obligations or responsibilities
under this compact, or the bylaws or rules of the Interstate Commission, the
Interstate Commission may impose any or all of the following penalties:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Remedial training and technical
assistance as directed by the Interstate Commission;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Alternative Dispute Resolution;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. Fines, fees and costs in such amounts as
are deemed to be reasonable as fixed by the Interstate Commission; and<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d. Suspension or termination of membership
in the compact, which shall be imposed only after all other reasonable means of
securing compliance under the bylaws and rules have been exhausted and the
Interstate Commission has determined that the offending state is in default.
Immediate notice of suspension shall be given by the Interstate Commission to
the Governor, the Chief Justice or the chief judicial officer, the majority and
minority leaders of the legislature and the state council of the defaulting
state. The grounds for default include, but are not limited to, failure of a
compacting state to perform such obligations or responsibilities imposed upon
it by this compact, the bylaws, or rules and any other grounds designated in
the bylaws and rules of the Interstate Commission. The Interstate Commission
shall immediately notify the defaulting state in writing of the penalty imposed
by the Interstate Commission and of the default pending a cure of the default.
The Interstate Commission shall stipulate the conditions and the time period
within which the defaulting state must cure its default. If the defaulting
state fails to cure the default within the time period specified by the
Interstate Commission, the defaulting state shall be terminated from the
compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the compacting states and all
rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this compact shall be terminated
from the effective date of termination.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Within sixty days of the effective date of
termination of a defaulting state, the Interstate Commission shall notify the
Governor, the Chief Justice or chief judicial officer, the majority and
minority leaders of the legislature and the state council of the defaulting
state of such termination.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. The defaulting state is responsible for
all assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective
date of termination including any obligations, the performance of which extends
beyond the effective date of termination.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. The Interstate Commission shall not bear
any costs relating to the defaulting state unless otherwise mutually agreed
upon in writing between the Interstate Commission and the defaulting state.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Reinstatement following termination of
any compacting state requires both a reenactment of the compact by the
defaulting state and the approval of the Interstate Commission pursuant to the
rules.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section C. Judicial Enforcement<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Interstate Commission may, by majority
vote of the members, initiate legal action in the United States District Court
for the District of Columbia or, at the discretion of the Interstate
Commission, for the federal district where the Interstate Commission has its
offices, to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and the rules
and bylaws of the Interstate Commission, against any compacting state in
default. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party
shall be awarded all costs of such litigation including reasonable attorney's fees.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section D. Dissolution of Compact<br>
<br>
<span class=GramE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1</span>. The compact
dissolves effective upon the date of the withdrawal or default of the
compacting state that reduces membership in the compact to one compacting
state.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Upon the dissolution of this compact,
the compact becomes void and shall be of no further force or effect, and the
business and affairs of the Interstate Commission shall be concluded and any

the constitutional limits imposed on the legislature of any compacting state,
the obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction sought to be conferred by such
provision upon the Interstate Commission shall be ineffective and such
obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction shall remain in the compacting
